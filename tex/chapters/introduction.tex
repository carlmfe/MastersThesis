This is where I introduce the master's thesis.


\section*{Outline}
This Master's thesis is roughly divided into three parts:
First, I will outline the theoretical framework for this thesis in two chapters.
This includes the perturbative quantum field theory (QFT) framework which I will use for the calculations, and building the supersymmetric model I will use in this framework.
Next, I go through the theoretical calculation of electroweakino pair production cross-sections in high-energy proton-proton collisions.
This includes perturbative leading order (LO) results for all possible electroweakino pairs, and next-to-leading order (NLO) results for neutralino pair production specifically.
