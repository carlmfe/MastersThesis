\section{Perturbative Quantum Field Theory}
In this thesis, I will use the Lagrangian framework to formulate QFT\@.
Here I will introduce the basics of how to formulate a QFT in such a way using the path integral formalism.
This leads to a perturbative formulation of scattering and computation of correlation functions, which is the basis for the calculations that will be made. \medskip



\subsection{The Path Integral}
I will start by introducing some useful shorthands that will be used throughout this section.
Consider an action \(S[\cclosed{\Phi}]\) as a functional of some classical fields \(\cclosed{\Phi}\). Let \(\phi_i \equiv \phi(x_i)\) for some arbitrary field \(\phi \in \cclosed{\Phi}\) evaluated at some point in space-time \(x_i\)---the path integral approach to quantum field theory is built on time-ordered correlation functions through the relation\needcite\
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:path_integral_correlation_function}
  \bra{\Omega} T\cclosed{\hat\phi_1 \cdots \hat\phi_n} \ket{\Omega} = \frac{\int\!\mathcal{D}\phi\, \phi_1 \cdots \phi_n \exp{iS[\cclosed{\Phi}]}}{\int\!\mathcal{D}\phi\, \exp{iS[\cclosed{\Phi}]}},
\end{equation}
where \(T\cclosed{.}\) denotes the time-ordering operation and \(\mathcal{D}\phi\) is the measure denoting integration over all possible \emph{field configurations}.
A field configuration here is understood as a given set of values for each of the fields \(\cclosed{\Phi}\), one for each point in space-time.
The time-ordering operation will put the fields in chronological order according to the time at which they are evaluated, with the ``first'' field being farthest to the right.
The left-hand side of \cref{qft:eq:path_integral_correlation_function} the fields are understood as operators on the Hilbert space of states in our interacting theory (denoted by their hats), and \(\ket{\Omega}\) is the vacuum state.
In this way quantum effects are encapsulated through the weighted sum of all classical \emph{paths} through configuration space, rather than just whichever one minimises the action.



\subsection{Perturbing the Free Theory}
In interacting theories, correlation functions can be obtained through a \emph{perturbation series} by expanding them around a coupling constant \(\lambda\), denoting the strength of the interaction.
To compute time-order correlation functions with \cref{qft:eq:path_integral_correlation_function}, we need to exponentiate the action.
Assuming that the Lagrangian of the action can be written on the form \(\L = \L_0 - \lambda\L_\text{int}\), this exponentiation can be written as
\begin{align}
  \exp{i \integral{^4x} \pclosed{\L_0 - \L_\text{int}}} = \exp{i \integral{^4x} \L_0} \pclosed{1 - i\lambda\integral{^4x_1} \L_\text{int}(x_1) - \frac{\lambda^2}{2} \integral{^4x_1}\integral{^4x_2} \L_\text{int}(x_1) \L_\text{int}(x_2) + \ldots}.
\end{align}
For simplicity, let us consider a theory with just one self-interacting field \(\phi\).
Now say the interaction Lagrangian \(\L_\text{int}\) is some monomial of degree \(p\) in \(\phi\),\footnote{In the more general case where it can be expressed with some polynomial in the fields, we can look at each monomial term separately, without loss of generality.} then the interacting correlation functions can be written in terms of free-theory correlation functions!
To see this, we consider the interacting \(n\)-point function \(D^n_\text{int}(1,\ldots, n) = \bra{\Omega} T\cclosed{\hat\phi_1 \cdots \hat\phi_n} \ket{\Omega}\), and write it out in terms of the free and interacting Lagrangians:
\begin{align}
  \label{qft:eq:n-point_interactive_correlator}
  D^n_\text{int}(1,\ldots, n) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{N}} \int\!\mathcal{D}\phi\, \phi_1\cdots \phi_n \exp{i\integral{^4x}\L_0}\pclosed{1 - i\lambda \integral{^4y}\L_\text{int} + \mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)},
\end{align}
where the normalisation is given by \(\mathcal{N} = \int\!\mathcal{D}\phi\, \exp{i\integral{^4x}\L}\).
To relate this to the free-theory, let us take a moment to write this out.
Given the free-field \(n\)-point correlator \(D^n_0(1,\ldots,n) \equiv \frac{1}{\mathcal{N}_0} \int\!\mathcal{D}\phi\, \phi_i \cdots \phi_n \exp{i\integral{^4x}\L_0}\) with normalisation \(\mathcal{N}_0 = \int\!\mathcal{D}\phi\, \exp{i\integral{^4x}\L_0}\), expanding the interacting normalisation gives
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{N} = \mathcal{N}_0 \pclosed{1 - i\lambda \integral{^4y} D_0^p(\underbrace{y, \ldots, y}_{p\text{ times}}) - \frac{\lambda^2}{2} \integral{^4y}\!\! \integral{^4z} D_0^{2p}(\underbrace{y,\ldots,y}_{p\text{ times}}, \underbrace{z,\ldots,z}_{p\text{ times}}) + \mathcal{O}(\lambda^3)}.
\end{equation}
Inserting this into \cref{qft:eq:n-point_interactive_correlator} and expanding around \(\lambda = 0\) we get
\begin{align}
  \label{qft:eq:n-point_interacting_correlator}
  \nonumber
    & D^n_\text{int}(1,\ldots, n) = \frac{D_0^n(1, \ldots, n) - i\lambda \integral{^4y} D_0^{n+p}(1, \ldots, n, \overbrace{y, \ldots, y}^{p\text{ times}}) + \mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)}{1 - i\lambda D_0^p(\underbrace{y, \ldots, y}_{p\text{ times}}) + \mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)} \\
  = & D^n_0(1,\ldots,n) - i\lambda \integral{^4y} \pclosed{D_0^{n+p}(1, \ldots, n, \underbrace{y, \ldots, y}_{p\text{ times}}) - D_0^n(1, \ldots, n) D_0^p(\underbrace{y, \ldots, y}_{p\text{ times}})} + \mathcal{O}(\lambda^2).
\end{align}
We can see from this that perturbation from \(\lambda = 0\) will give corrections to the free two-point correlator that add correlations with additional space-time points that are integrated over.
These additional self-correlating points will diagrammatically form loops, as we will see an example of in the next section.
I note that the role of the second term of order \(\lambda\) is to remove all \emph{disconnected} diagrams that contribute to the first term.
Disconnected diagrams are diagrams where the self-correlating additional space-time points are not connected to the external space-time points, and as such should not be causally related to them.


\subsection{Feynman Rules in Position Space}
Let us now investigate closer what we can get from the expansion around the free theory \cref{qft:eq:n-point_interacting_correlator}.
To do this, let us consider a concrete theory, given by the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \L = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}(\partial\^\mu \phi)(\partial\_\mu\phi) - \frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2}_{\L_0} - \lambda \underbrace{\phi^4}_{\L_\text{int}}.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, I will use the Schwinger-Dyson equations~\cite{Schwartz:2014sze} for the free-theory, which tell us that
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:Schwinger-Dyson_n-point}
  (\dA_x + m^2) D_0^{n+1}(x, 1, \ldots, n) = -i\sum_{i} \delta^4(x-x_i) D_0^{n-1}(1, \ldots, i-1, i+1, \ldots, n),
\end{equation}
from which it follows that
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:Schwinger-Dyson_2-point}
  (\dA_x + m^2) D^2_0(x,y) = -i \delta^4(x-y).
\end{equation}

Consider the 2-point correlator \(D_{\text{int}}^2(1,2)\) of the interacting theory.
By \cref{qft:eq:n-point_interacting_correlator}, this is given to first order in \(\lambda\) by
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:phi4_2-point_correlator}
  D_{\text{int}}^2(1,2) = D_0^2(1,2) - i\lambda \integral{^4y} \pclosed{D_0^6(1,2,y,y,y,y) - D_0^2(1,2)D_0^4(y,y,y,y)}.
\end{equation}
Using a cute trick to insert a Dirac delta-function, we can use \cref{qft:eq:Schwinger-Dyson_2-point} to rewrite to six-point correlator
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  D_0^6(1,2,y,y,y,y) = & \integral{^4x} \delta^4(x-x_1) D_0^6(x,2,y,y,y,y)            \\
  \nonumber
  =                    & i\integral{^4x} (\dA_x + m^2) D^2_0(x,1) D_0^6(x,2,y,y,y,y)  \\
  =                    & i\integral{^4x} D^2_0(x,1) (\dA_x + m^2) D_0^6(x,2,y,y,y,y),
\end{align}
where \(\dA = \partial\^\mu \partial\_\mu\) is the d'Alembertian operator and in the last equality I have used partial integration twice.
We can then use \cref{qft:eq:Schwinger-Dyson_n-point} to get
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  D_0^6(1,2,y,y,y,y) = & \integral{^4x} D^2_0(x,1) \cclosed{\delta^4(x-x_2) D_0^4(y,y,y,y) + 4\delta^4(x-y)D_0^4(2,y,y,y)} \\
  =                    & D_0^2(1,2) D_0^4(y,y,y,y) + 4 D_0^2(1,y)D_0^4(2,y,y,y),
\end{align}
where I have used the property of the correlators that they are symmetric in its arguments because of the time-ordering operator.
Notice that the first term here will cancel the last term in \cref{qft:eq:phi4_2-point_correlator} as promised.
We can now use the same procedure to write out the four-point correlator
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  D_0^4(2,y,y,y) = & = i\integral{^4x} (\dA_x + m^2) D_0^2(x,2) D_0^4(x,y,y,y)                      \\
  =                & \integral{^4x} D_0^2(x,2) 3 \delta^4(x-y) D_0^2(y,y) = 3D_0^2(y,y) D_0^2(y,2).
\end{align}
Putting it all together in \cref{qft:eq:phi4_2-point_correlator}, we get that the interacting two-point correlator in this theory is
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:phi4_2-point_correlator}
  D_{\text{int}}^2(1, 2) = D_0^2(1, 2) - 12 i \lambda \integral{^4y} D_0^2(1, y) D_0^2(y, y) D_0^2(y, 2)
\end{equation}
to first order in the coupling constant \(\lambda\).

This procedure can be put together diagrammatically -- associating the free two-point correlators \(D_0^2(x,y)\) with edges between two points \(x, y\), and vertices where multiple edges meet with a factor of \(i k \lambda \integral{^4x}\), where \(k\) is the number of configurations of equal fields in \(\L_\text{int}\).
Due to this last point, it is therefore common to rescale the Lagrangian parameter \(\lambda \to \frac{\lambda}{k}\), such that the insertions will not contain any numerical factors.
In the case of our \(\phi^4\) theory, we should have \(k = 4!\), however, comparing to our result in \cref{qft:eq:phi4_2-point_correlator} we see that we only have a numerical factor of \(12 = \frac{4!}{2}\).
This is a result of the \emph{symmetry factor} of the diagram, as the loop in \(y\) is (trivially) symmetric under exchange of its endpoints.
By including the factor of \(p!\) in the vertex rule, we must divide by the symmetry factor, which are the number of ways you can change the edges of a diagram and still get the same result.
Another subtlety relates to the factor of \(\frac{1}{n!}\) associated with the \(\lambda^n\) term in the perturbation expansion \cref{qft:eq:n-point_interacting_correlator}.
This coincides with the fact that the \(n\)th order term is gives equal contributions under the interchange of its internal vertices.
There are \(n!\) ways of interchanging these vertices, and so this factor cancels out neatly in the end.
\medskip

Returning to our example, we can depict \cref{qft:eq:phi4_2-point_correlator} diagrammatically by
\begin{align}
  D_{\text{int}}^n(1, 2) = & \inputtikz[baseline=(x1.base)]{phi4/LO_propagator} + \inputtikz[baseline=(x1.base)]{phi4/NLO_propagator}.
\end{align}
I have denoted \emph{vertices} associated with the coupling constant insertion with filled dots, and external points with empty dots for clarity.
This practice will not be kept for the remainder of the thesis.
\medskip

In summary, the following rules relate a Feynman diagram to the two-point correlators of the free theory:
\begin{itemize}
  \item [(I)] A factor of \(D_0^2(x, y)\) for every edge connecting two points \(x, y\).
  \item [(II)] A factor of \(-i\lambda \integral{^4x}\) for every internal vertex point \(x\).
  \item [(III)] An overall numerical factor of \(S^{-1}\), where \(S\) the symmetry factor. This is the total number of ways internal lines can be exchanged without changing the diagram.
\end{itemize}
To get the full correlator to a given perturbative order, we must sum over all \emph{different}, connected Feynman diagrams to that order.


\subsection{The \(S\)-Matrix and LSZ Reduction Formula}
To relate the correlation functions above to physical experiment, e.g.\ scattering amplitudes.
Let us for a moment go to the quantum mechanical picture of Hilbert space formalism to formulate a scattering experiment.
Idealising the scenario, let us consider the amplitude of an \emph{asymptotic} in-state \(\ket{\psi_i}\) of free fields at \(t=-\infty\) evolving into an asymptotic out-state \(\ket{\psi_f}\) of some other fields at \(t=+\infty\).
The interaction between is captured by the \(S\)-matrix, and the amplitude is given by the inner product
\begin{equation}
  \bra{\psi_f} S \ket{\psi_i}.
\end{equation}
The LSZ reduction formula due to Lehmann, Symanzik and Zimmermann~\cite{LSZ} relates this amplitude to the correlation functions we have above.
Given initial fields with momenta \(p_1, \ldots, p_k\) and final fields with momenta \(p_{k+1}, \ldots, p_n\) in our scalar theory, it reads~\cite{Schwartz:2014sze}
\begin{align}
  \label{qft:eq:S-matrix}
  \nonumber
  \bra{p_{k+1}\cdots p_n} S \ket{p_1 \cdots p_k} = \pclosed{\prod_{i=1}^k i \integral{^4x_i} \exp{-ip_i \cdot x_i} (\dA_{x_i} + m^2)} \\
  \times \pclosed{\prod_{i=k+1}^n i \integral{^4x_i} \exp{+ip_i \cdot x_i} (\dA_{x_i} + m^2)}
  \times \bra{\Omega} \operatorname{T}\cclosed{\phi(x_1)\cdots \phi(x_n)} \ket{\Omega}.
\end{align}

Usually, we encapsulate the information of the \(S\)-matrix in \emph{matrix elements} \(\M\) by writing it on the form
\begin{equation}
  S = \eye + i(2\pi)^4 \delta^4(\sum_{i=1}^k p_i - \sum_{i=k+1}^n p_i) \M,
\end{equation}
essentially dropping the trivial overlap between the in- and out-states and factoring out momentum conservation.
\medskip

Let us now put this to use our scalar toy model, computing the transition for a field with momentum \(p_1\) to end up with momentum \(p_2\) using \cref{qft:eq:S-matrix} to first order in \(\lambda\):
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  \bra{p_2} S \ket{p_1} = & \pclosed{i\integral{^4x_1} \exp{-ip_1 \cdot x_1} (\dA_{x_1} + m^2)} \pclosed{ i \integral{^4x_2} \exp{+ip_2 \cdot x_2} (\dA_{x_2} + m^2)} \times D_{\text{int}}^2(1, 2) \\
  \nonumber
  =                       & -\integral{^4x_1} \exp{-ip_1 \cdot x_1} (\dA_{x_1} + m^2) \integral{^4x_2} \exp{+ip_2 \cdot x_2} (\dA_{x_2} + m^2)                                                      \\
  \nonumber
                          & \times \cclosed{D_0^2(1,2) - \frac{i\lambda}{2} \integral{^4y} D_0^2(1,y)D_0^2(y,y) D_0^2(y,2) + \mathcal{O}(\lambda)}                                                  \\
  \nonumber
  =                       & -\integral{^4x_1} \exp{-ip_1 \cdot x_1} (\dA_{x_1} + m^2) \cclosed{i \exp{ip_2\cdot x_1} - \frac{\lambda}{2}\integral{^4y} \exp{-ip_2\cdot y} D_0^2(1,y) D_0^2(y,y)}    \\
  =                       & \integral{^4x_1} \cclosed{-i (p^2_2 - m^2)- \frac{i\lambda}{2} D_0^2(x_1,x_1)} \exp{-i(p_1-p_2) \cdot x_1},
\end{align}
where in the second equality I inserted \cref{qft:eq:phi4_2-point_correlator}, in the third and fourth equalities I used the Schwinger-Dyson equation \cref{qft:eq:Schwinger-Dyson_2-point}.
By the on-shell condition on \(p_2\), the first term vanishes.
For the second term, we can use that the two-point correlator is given by its Fourier transform as
\begin{equation}
  D_0^2(x,y) = \loopintegral{k} \tilde{D}_0^2(k) \exp{ik\cdot(x-y)},
\end{equation}
to arrive at
\begin{equation}
  \bra{p_2} S \ket{p_1} = -i(2\pi)^4 \delta^4(p_1 - p_2) \frac{\lambda}{2} \loopintegral{k} \tilde{D}_0^2(k).
\end{equation}

We can relate this to the matrix element \(\M\), using the orthogonality relation of the momentum states \(\bra{p^\prime} \eye \ket{p} = (2\pi)^4 \delta^4(p-p^\prime)\), to find that
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  \bra{p_2} i(2\pi)^4 \delta^4(p_2-p_1) \M \ket{p_1} = \bra{p_2} S \ket{p_1} - (2\pi)^4 \delta^4(p_2-p_1) \\
  \Rightarrow i\M = -1 - \frac{i \lambda}{2} \loopintegral{k} D_0^2(k).
\end{align}

This result can also be arrived at diagrammatically, leading us to define Feynman diagrams and Feynman rules in \emph{momentum space}.
The procedure for drawing diagrams is the same as before, but now every external point is associated with an external momentum, and every line carries momentum with it.
Momentum flow can be indicated with arrows for clarity.
The resulting Feynman rules are similar to before, but now give:
\begin{itemize}
  \item [(I)] A factor of \(\tilde{D}_0^2(p)\) for every \emph{internal} line associated with momentum a momentum \(p\).
  \item [(II)] A factor if \(-i\lambda\) for every internal vertex point.
  \item [(III)] External points are associated with a factor of \(1\).
  \item [(IV)] Momentum conservation should be enforced through every vertex point.
  \item [(V)] Any undetermined momentum \(k\) of internal lines must be integrated over with a factor \(\loopintegral{k}\).
  \item [(VI)] An overall numerical factor of \(S^{-1}\), where \(S\) the symmetry factor. This is the total number of ways internal lines can be exchanged without changing the diagram.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Feynman Rules for Fermions}
Later on, we will be considering fermion fields, which have spinor structure.
I go into more detail on spinors in \cref{app:chap:weyl_grassmann}.
When considering correlation functions of spinor fields, it is usually most convenient to work with the correlation of Lorentz-invariant contractions of the spinor field components.
This imposes some additional structure on the terms Feynman rules.
More generally, external fermion points will be associated with spinors, whereas propagators and vertices can be operators on spinor space.\footnote{In fact, these arguments hold for other Lorentz structures such as four-vectors or tensors of any rank.}

Let us first consider the external fermions.
Consider a Dirac spinor field \(\psi\) with a conjugate field \(\bar\psi\) with mass \(m\), the general, quantised solution for a free Dirac spinor field is~\cite{Peskin}
\begin{equation}
  \psi(x) = \loopintegral[3]{p} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_{\vec{p}}}} \sum_s \pclosed{a_s(\vec{p}) u_s(p) \exp{-i p\cdot x} + b_s^\dagger(\vec{p}) v_s(p) \exp{i p\cdot x}},
\end{equation}
where \(E_{\vec{p}} = m^2 + \vec{p}^2\), \(u_s(p), v_s(p)\) are particle and antiparticle spinors of spin \(s\), and \(a_s^\dagger(\vec{p}), b_s^\dagger(\vec{p})\) are creation operators creating particle and antiparticle states with momentum \(\vec{p}\) and spin \(s\) respectively.
Normalisation is chosen such that \(a_s^\dagger(\vec{p}) \ket{0} = \sqrt{2E_{\vec{p}}} \ket{\vec{p}, s}\) and \(\braket{\vec{q}, r}{\vec{p}, s} = 2E_{\vec{p}} (2\pi)^3 \delta^3(\vec{p}-\vec{q}) \delta_{rs}\), where \(\ket{\vec{p}, s}\) denotes a fermionic particle state with momentum \(\vec{p}\) and spin \(s\).

The derivation of the LSZ reduction formula will differ slightly going from scalar theory to the fermionic one.
Particularly, we need the inner product
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  \bra{0}\psi(x)\ket{\vec{q},r} = & \loopintegral[3]{p} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_{\vec{p}}}} \sum_s \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_{\vec{p}}}} \bra{\vec{p}, s}  u_s(p) \exp{-i p\cdot x} \ket{\vec{q}, s}                          \\
  \nonumber
  =                               & \loopintegral[3]{p} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_{\vec{p}}}} \sum_s \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_{\vec{p}}}} 2E_{\vec{p}} (2\pi)^3 \delta^3(\vec{p}-\vec{q}) \delta_{rs} u_s(p) \exp{-i p\cdot x} \\
  =                               & u_r(q) \exp{-i q\cdot x},
\end{align}
where I have used that \(q^2 = p^2 = m^2\) such that when \(\vec{q} = \vec{p}\) we have \(q^0 = p^0\).
This differs from the scalar theory where \(\bra{0} \phi(x) \ket{\vec{q}} = \exp{-i q\cdot x}\).
In the end, the effect this has is that external fermion points of Feynman diagrams will be associated with the corresponding spinors, instead of the trivial factor of \(1\) for the scalar theory.
\medskip

For a Lorentz-invariant theory, the Lagrangian will only contain Lorentz invariant contractions of the spinors, all of which can be decomposed into Dirac \emph{bilinears} on the form
\begin{equation}
  \bar\psi \Gamma\^r \psi,
\end{equation}
where \(\Gamma^r\) form a basis for operators on spinor space.
One realisation of such a basis is \(\Gamma\^r = \cclosed{\eye, \gamma\^\mu, \sigma\^{\mu\nu}, \gamma\^\mu \gamma\^5, \gamma\^5}\), where \(\sigma\^{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} \bclosed{\gamma\^\mu, \gamma\^\nu}\) and we understand \(\nu < \mu\).
Feynman rules for propagators and vertices will generally contain Lorentz invariant linear combinations of such operators.

With the additional spinor structure in the diagrams, it is important that the spinors and operators on spinor space are ordered correctly, as to produce the intended contractions.
This is usually done by defining a \emph{fermion flow} in the diagrams, usually denoted by an arrow on the fermion lines.
The procedure goes like this:
Starting at the end of a fermion flow, insert spinors associated with external lines and spinor operators associated with internal lines and vertices until you get to the start of the fermion flow.
Repeat this for all separated fermion flows in the diagram.

Another point of subtelty is that fermionic spinor fields are anticommuting.
This causes the fermionic correlation functions become antisymmetric under interchange of the fermions, e.g.\ \(D_\psi^2(1, 2) = -D_\psi^2(2, 1)\).
There are two important consequences of this:
Firstly, closed fermion loops get an overall factor of \(-1\).
Secondly, different diagrams get a \emph{relative sign of interfering Feynman diagrams} (RSIF).
By keeping the order the external spinors consistent between diagrams, a different amount of permutations might happen.
The overall minus sign of the amplitude will be amigious, depending on how you choose to order the spinors, but relative signs between diagrams that are added together will change.
It can be resolved by looking at the order in which external spinors come in the amplitude, giving an additional minus sign to spinor orders that are an odd permutation as compared to some arbitrary reference permutation.
\medskip

Summarised, the additional Feynman rules of fermions are
\begin{itemize}
  \item [(I)] External spinors and vertex factors are inserted starting at the end of every fermion flow, moving backwards. Incoming (outgoing) fermion particles of momentum \(p\) and spin \(s\) are associated with a factor \(u_s(p)\) (\(\bar{u}_s(p)\)). Incoming (outgoing) fermion \emph{anti}-particles of momentum \(p\) and spin \(s\) are associated with a factor \(\bar{v}_s(p)\) (\(v_s(p)\)).
  \item [(II)] A factor of \(-1\) is associated with every closed fermion loop.
  \item [(III)] A RSIF is assigned to any diagram by evaluating the parity of the order in which spinors arise as compared to some freely chosen reference order. The reference order must be kept consistent throughout all diagrams.
\end{itemize}
\medskip

Lastly, I will note a point of complexity when dealing with Majorana fermions, i.e.\ fermions that are their own anti-particles.
Fermion flows as we have defined them can lead to amiguities when dealing such fermions.
This is because the fermion flows can be defined to go both ways, as the same operators are used to create both particle and anti-particle spinors \(u_s(p)/v_s(p)\), creating amiguity in the RSIF of specific diagrams.
To alleviate this, I will follow a prescription due to Denner et al.~\cite{Denner:1992vza}.
Arrows on lines will be used \emph{particle number flow}, used both for Dirac fermions and particle number conserving scalar fields.
Fermion flows, however, will be denoted with an additional arrow along fermion lines.
These flows can be defined arbirtarily, but the Feynman rules will be amended by whether the flow goes with/against the particle number flow, and into/out of vertices.
By using the approriate, amended Feynman rules proposed in~\cite{Denner:1992vza}, the fermion flows can be defined any way we would like, and the RSIF due to the parity of the spinor permutation can be inserted naively.
The amended Feynman rules make sure that the RSIF will be correct, even though fermion flows are not defined consistently between the diagrams.
In fermion lines with only Majorana particles, Feynman rules are the same regardless of fermion flow, however, for Dirac fermions, the following amendments are made:
\begin{itemize}
  \item [(I)] Momentum space propagators \(\tilde{D}_0^2(p)\) for a fermion propagator is replaced by \(\tilde{D}_0^2(-p)\) if the particle number flow goes against the fermion flow. Otherwise, the ordinary propagator is used.
  \item [(II)] For vertex rules including Dirac fermions, the spinor operator \(\Gamma\) associated with the vertex must be replace by \(C\Gamma^T C^{-1}\) if the fermion flow is defined contrary to the particle number flow. Here \(C\) is the charge conjugation matrix, which I detail in \cref{app:chap:weyl_grassmann}.
\end{itemize}
The charge conjugation matrices are defined such that their effect on the basis operators on spinor space is
\begin{equation}
  C \Gamma_r^T C^{-1} = \eta_r \Gamma_r, \qquad \eta_r = \begin{cases}
    1  & \text{for }\eye, \gamma\^5, \gamma\_\mu \gamma\^5 \\
    -1 & \text{for }\gamma\_\mu, \sigma\_{\mu\nu}
  \end{cases}.
\end{equation}

I exemplify this use of arrows indicating particle number flow and fermion flow in \cref{qft:fig:feynman_flow}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \inputtikz{fermion_flow_example}
  \caption{Example of the arrow usage that will be used in this thesis.
    There is an incoming Dirac fermion \(\psi\) with a particle number flow indicated with the arrow on its line.
    Likewise, a complex scalar \(\phi\) has an arrow on its line indicating particle number flow.
    A Majorana fermion \(\chi\) has no such particle number flow indication.
    The arrow above the vertex indicates the defined fermion flow for this diagram.}

\section{Renormalised Quantum Field Theory}
\phpar[Talk about loop integrals, divergences, regularisation and
  renormalisation.]

\todo{Mention Wick rotation and evaluation of loop integrals?}

Divergences appear in perturbative correlation functions in QFT, and can be
categorised into \emph{ultraviolet} (UV) divergences and \emph{infrared} (IR)
divergences. They are so named after which region of momentum space they
originate from --- high momentum for UV and low momentum for IR\@. The two types
of divergences are dealt with entirely differently, and here I will lay out how
to deal with UV divergences through \emph{renormalisation}.
\medskip

Consider a loop like the one in \cref{qft:fig:example_loop}:
If we consider a massless particle in the loop, and massless external particles \(p^2 = 0\), the loop integral will take the form\footnote{The first equality here is in fact somewhat subtle. One can see it by introducing Feynman parametrisation like in \cref{app:sec:feynman_parametrisation} and shifting the integration variable.}
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:example_loop}
  \loopintegral[4]{q} \frac{1}{(q^2+i\epsilon)((q-p)^2+i\epsilon)} = \loopintegral[4]{q} \frac{1}{\pclosed{q^2 + i\epsilon}^2} =
  \frac{i}{(2\pi)^4} \integral{\Omega_4} \integral[_0^\infty]{q_E}
  \frac{1}{q_E},
\end{equation}
which diverges for both low and high momenta. \comment{Mention what went into
this integral, i.e.\ Wick rotation and \(i\epsilon\).} Had the particle been
massive, the momentum would have a non-zero lower limit, and the IR divergence
would disappear.
However, the UV divergence must be handled differently.





\subsection{Regularisation}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \inputtikz{ex_loop}
  \caption{Simple example of a loop diagram in a scalar theory.}
  \label{qft:fig:example_loop}
\end{figure}

A first step to handle the divergences is to deform our theory in some way to
make the loop integral formally finite, but recovering the divergence in the
limit that the deformation disappears. An intuitive deformation would be to cap
the momentum integral at some \(\Lambda\), recovering our original theory in
the limit \(\Lambda \to \infty\). To illustrate the procedure of regularisation
and subsequently renormalisation, it will be useful to have an example, for
which I choose a scalar Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:example_lagrangian}
  \L = \frac{1}{2} \pclosed{\partial_\mu\phi}^2 - \frac{1}{2}m_\phi^2 \phi^2 - \frac{\lambda}{3!} \phi^3.
\end{equation}
\comment{Perhaps introduce this model earlier?} Regularising the IR divergence
in \cref{qft:eq:example_loop} by giving our scalar a mass \(m\), and the UV
divergence with a momentum cap \(\Lambda\), we are left with
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  \int_{\abs{q} < \Lambda}\! \frac{\mathrm{d}^4q}{(2\pi)^4}
  \frac{1}{\pclosed{(q^2-m^2)+i\epsilon}^2} = \frac{i}{(2\pi)^4}
  \integral{\Omega_4} \integral[_0^\Lambda]{q_E} \frac{q_E^3}{\pclosed{q_E^2
      -
  m^2}^2} \\
  = \frac{i}{16\pi^2} \cclosed{\ln\pclosed{1 + \frac{\Lambda^2}{m^2}} -
    \frac{\Lambda^2}{\Lambda^2 + m^2}},
\end{align}
where now evidently the divergences manifest as a logarithm.
\medskip

Another popular choice of regularisation, which I will use in this thesis, is
\emph{dimensional regularisation}. It entails analytically continuing the
number of space-time dimension from the ordinary 4 dimensions to \(d
= 4-2\epsilon\) dimensions for some small \(\epsilon\).\footnote{The reason for choosing \(2\epsilon\) is purely aesthetical, making some expressions neater later on.} This removes much of
the intuition for what we are doing, but turns out to be computationally very
efficient. Our loop integral \cref{qft:eq:example_loop} will then turn into
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  \loopintegral[d]{q} \frac{1}{\pclosed{q^2+i\epsilon}^2} = \frac{i
    2\pi^{\sfrac{d}{2}}}{(2\pi)^d} \frac{1}{\Gamma(\sfrac{d}{2})}
  \integral[_0^\infty]{q} q_E^{d-5} \\
  = \frac{i 2\pi^{2-\epsilon}}{(2\pi)^{4-2\epsilon}}
  \frac{1}{\Gamma\pclosed{2-\epsilon}} \cclosed{ \integral[_0^\mu]{q}
  \frac{1}{q_E^{1+2\epsilon}} + \integral[_\mu^\infty]{q}
  \frac{1}{q_E^{1+2\epsilon}} } = \frac{i}{16\pi^2}
  \pclosed{\frac{1}{\epsilon_\text{IR}} - \frac{1}{\epsilon_\text{UV}}} +
  O(\epsilon),
\end{align}
where in the second equality, the momentum integral is split into a low-energy and high-energy part at some scale \(\mu\).
Here a trick was performed, as the low-energy part requires \(\epsilon < 0\) to be convergent, whereas the high-energy part requires \(\epsilon>0\).
The two different divergences thus require different deformations of the theory to be finite, and should be handled separately, hence the subscripts.
It is a general result that divergences coming from the low-energy parts of momentum integrals require \(\epsilon_{\text{IR}} < 0\), whereas high-energy divergences require \(\epsilon_{\text{UV}} > 0\), and this can be used to identify the source of divergences when using dimensional regularisation.
In the end divergences when using dimensional regularisation come out as \(\frac{1}{\epsilon^p}\)-terms, for some power \(p\).






\subsection{Counterterm Renormalisation}
\label{qft:subsec:counterterms}
To take care of UV divergences, we note that there is freedom in how we define the contents of our Lagrangian.
We should be able to rescale our fields \(\phi_0 = \sqrt{Z_\phi} \phi\), and rescale our couplings like \(m_{\phi,0}^2 = Z_m m_\phi^2\) and \(\lambda_0 = Z_\lambda \lambda\).
Although suggestively naming terms such as \emph{mass term} with mass \(m_\phi^0\) implies a connection to the mass of a particle, we have yet to define what that would mean experimentally.
Thus, rescaling our parameters and fields parametrises the way in which we can tune our theory, allowing us freedom in choosing the way our theory connects to experiments.

This approach of rescaling actually allows us to make a perturbative scheme for fixing our (re)normalisations of the fields and couplings.
There are many choices for how to connect theory to experiment, but one common approach for field and mass renormalisation is to identify the pole in momentum space of the two-point correlation function \(\mathcal{G}(x, y)\) of a particle to the mass resonance  associated with the on-shell production of a particle in scattering experiments.
This allows us to perturbatively calculate the two-point correlator, and then fix our normalisations accordingly, such that our imposed condition on it holds at every order in the perturbation series.
We achieve this systematically with \emph{counterterms}, which in essence are additional Feynman rules added to the theory. By expanding the renormalisation parameters as \(Z = 1 + \delta\), the \(\delta\) will carry the correction to the normalisation to any given order in a coupling constant.
To one-loop order, the self-energy of our scalar theory from \cref{qft:eq:example_lagrangian} is diagrammatically given by
\begin{equation*}
  \inputtikz[baseline=(in.base)]{SE_LO} +
  \inputtikz[baseline=(in.base)]{SE_NLO} +
  \inputtikz[baseline=(in.base)]{SE_cnt},
\end{equation*}
where the crossed dot represents an insertion of the \(\delta\) into the LO amplitude.
Since the free theory is divergence free, the counterterms only needs to carry corrections from the first order in the coupling constant that loops arise.
They are therefore understood to be of one-loop order, or NLO\@.




\subsection{On-Shell Renormalisation}
\label{qft:subsec:on_shell_renormalsiation}
Categorising all higher order contributions that can arise to the LO
self-energy of a massive particle, they come in the form of
\emph{one-particle-irreducible} (1PI) diagrams. These are diagrams where all
lines with loop momentum running through are connected. Other diagrams can be
reconstructed as the sum of 1PI diagrams. Denoting the leading order correlator
\(\mathcal{G}_0(p)\) and the contribution from one insertion of all 1PI
diagrams \(i\Sigma(p)\), we get a series\footnote{A note on the argument \(p\)
  of these functions: The two-point-correlators in momentum space depend on
  the
  four-momentum \(p^\mu\) in such a way that when it is put in between the
  external particle representations (i.e.\ 1 for scalars, spinors for
  fermions
  and polarisation vectors for vector bosons) the result will be Lorentz
  invariant. This means in principle that the correlator could carry Lorentz
  indices too, which will be suppressed here for simplicity.}
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  i\mathcal{G}(p) = & \inputtikz[baseline=(in.base)]{SE_LO} +
  \inputtikz[baseline=(in.base)]{SE_1PI} +
  \inputtikz[baseline=(in.base)]{SE_2PI} + \ldots
  \\
  \nonumber
  =                 & i\mathcal{G}_0(p) + i\mathcal{G}_0(p) i\Sigma(p)
  i\mathcal{G}_0(p) + i\mathcal{G}_0(p) i\Sigma(p) i\mathcal{G}_0(p)
  i\Sigma(p)
  i\mathcal{G}_0(p) + \ldots
  \\
  \nonumber
  =                 & i\mathcal{G}_0(p) \bclosed{i\Sigma(p) i\mathcal{G}_0(p)
    + \pclosed{i\Sigma(p) i\mathcal{G}_0(p)}^2 + \ldots}
  \\
  =                 & i\mathcal{G}_0(p) \frac{1}{1 + \Sigma(p)
    \mathcal{G}_0(p)} = \frac{i}{\mathcal{G}_0^{-1}(p) + \Sigma(p)}.
\end{align}
So the computation of the two-point correlator to any order can be done simply
by computing the sum of the 1PI diagrams to that order. These contributions
will generally diverge, but then we can take into account the renormalisation
parameters. Since this is a \emph{bare} function, i.e.\ using the
non-renormalised quantities, we can get the renormalised two-point correlator
\(\mathcal{G}^\text{R}(p)\) through
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{G}^\text{R}(p) = \frac{1}{Z_\psi} \mathcal{G}^\text{bare}(p) =
  \frac{1}{1 + \delta_\psi} \mathcal{G}^\text{bare}(p),
\end{equation}
for any field \(\psi\), seeing as the two-point correlator is quadratic in
\(\psi\) and thereby quadratic in \(\sqrt{Z_\psi}\).
\medskip

On-shell mass renormalisation seeks to identify the pole of the two-point correlator with the physical mass as observed in experiment.
This is a generalisation the property of the free theory two-point function to the perturbative interacting two-point function at any order.
It yields two conditions:
\begin{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [(I)] \(\evalat{\bclosed{(1+\delta_\psi)\pclosed{\mathcal{G}^\text{bare}_0(p)}^{-1}
              + \Sigma(p)}}{p^2 = m_\text{pole}^2} = 0\),
    \item [(II)] \(\operatorname{Res}\cclosed{\mathcal{G}^\text{R}(p), p^2
            = m_\text{pole}^2} = 1\),
  \end{itemize}
\end{center}
where \(\operatorname{Res}\cclosed{f(z), z = z_0}\) is the residue of the
function \(f\) at \(z_0\).
\medskip

For our scalar theory, where the leading order \emph{bare} two-point correlator is
\(\mathcal{G}_0^\text{bare}(p) =\frac{1}{p^2 - m_0^2}\), this means that we get the
relations
\begin{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [(I)] \(\delta_m m_\phi^2 = \Sigma(m_\phi^2)\),
    \item [(II)] \(\delta_\phi = -\evalat{\d[p^2]{}\Sigma(p^2)}{p^2 =
            m_\phi^2}\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{center}
\medskip

Later on, I will make use of \emph{chiral} on-shell renormalisation.
This happens in chiral theories where the left-handed and right-handed degrees of freedom i fermion fields are treated differently in the Lagrangian.
This means that divergent corrections to the two-point correlator can be different between the fermion chiralities.
Still using Dirac spinor notation, we can then rescale a fermion \(\psi\)
\begin{equation}
  \psi^0 = \sqrt{Z_L} P_L \psi + \sqrt{Z_R} P_R \psi,
\end{equation}
where \(P_{L/R} = \frac{1}{2}(1 \mp \gamma^5)\) are the chiral projection operators, and work out and renormalise the two-point correlators separately.
Expanding \(Z_{L/R} = 1 + \delta_{L/R}\) and writing the \(\Sigma(\slashed{p}) = \Sigma_L(\slashed{p})P_L + \Sigma_R(\slashed{p})P_R\) we end up with three conditions analogous to the case above:
\begin{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [(I)] \(\delta_m m_\psi = \evalat{\Sigma}{\slashed{p}=m_\psi}\),
    \item [(II)] \(\delta_L = -\evalat{\d[\slashed{p}]{}\Sigma_L(\slashed{p})}{\slashed{p} = m_\psi}\),
    \item [(III)] \(\delta_R = -\evalat{\d[\slashed{p}]{}\Sigma_R(\slashed{p})}{\slashed{p} = m_\psi}\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{center}

\section{Yang-Mills Theories}
\label{qft:sec:yang-mills}

Gauge theory in QFT is based on imposing \emph{internal symmetries} on the Lagrangian.
Internal symmetries are symmetries separate from \emph{external symmetries} in that they are not symmetries of coordinate transformations, but rather symmetries based on transformations of the fields.
Typically, the field transformations under which the Lagrangian is invariant are Lie groups, and are referred to as the \emph{gauge group}.
A collection of fields that transform into each other under a particular representation\footnote{More on this later.} is called a \emph{multiplet}.

Let us consider a complex scalar field theory to illustrate.
Let \(\phi_i\) be a multiplet of complex scalar fields, and let the gauge group be a general non-Abelian Lie group, locally defined by a set of hermitian generators \(T^a\).
Locally, the group elements can then be described using the exponential map as\needcite\
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:exponential_map}
  g(\vec{\alpha}) = \exptext{i \alpha^a T^a},
\end{equation}
for a set of real parameters \(\vec{\alpha}\).\footnote{I will use bold
  notation \(\vec\alpha\) to refer to the collection of parameters
  \(\alpha^a\), of which there is one for each generator \(T^a\).}
This way of parametrising the group is convenient in that the inverse of the group elements are the hermitian conjugate, i.e.\ \(g^{-1}(\vec\alpha) = g^\dagger(\vec{\alpha})\).
The transformation law for \(\Phi = \pclosed{\phi_1, \ldots}^T\) is
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:gauge_transformation}
  \Phi \to g(\vec{\alpha}) \Phi = \exptext{i \alpha^a T^a} \Phi,
\end{equation}
which for an infinitesimal set of parameters \(\epsilon^a\) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \Phi \to \pclosed{1 + i \epsilon^a T^a} \Phi.
\end{equation}
\medskip


Now, we would like to categorise the Lagrangian terms that are invariant under
such transformations.
The ordinary free Klein-Gordon Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \L_\text{KG} = \partial^\mu \Phi^\dagger \partial_\mu \Phi - m^2 \Phi^\dagger \Phi
\end{equation}
is invariant.
However, if we promote our gauge symmetry to be a local symmetry, i.e.\ let the
parameters become spacetime-dependent \(\vec{\alpha} \to \vec{\alpha}(x)\),
this is no longer the case.
Since space-time coordinates are unchanged under gauge transformations, it
follows that so too is the derivative \(\partial_\mu\).
However, it will be useful to rewrite this in as somewhat convoluted way,
letting it ``transform'' according to\footnote{It can be shown to be equivalent
  to \(\partial_\mu\) when applied to any field (whether they transform under
  the
  gauge transformations or not).}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{In the following I suppress the
  argument so that \(g = g\pclosed{\vec{\alpha}(x)}\).}
\begin{equation}
  \partial_\mu \to \partial_\mu = g \partial_\mu g^{-1} +
  \pclosed{\partial_\mu g} g^{-1},
\end{equation}
which in turn makes the field derivative transform to
\begin{equation}
  \partial_\mu \Phi \to g \partial_\mu \Phi + \pclosed{\partial_\mu g} \Phi,
\end{equation}
which does \emph{not} leave the kinetic term invariant.
So we must rethink the kinetic term of the Lagrangian.
To get the right transformation properties of the derivative term, we need a
\emph{covariant derivate } \(D_\mu\) such that \(D_\mu \Phi \to g D_\mu
\Phi\).
In order to create such a \(D_\mu\), we must require that it transforms as
\(D_\mu \to g D_\mu g^{-1}\).
This can be done by introducing the \emph{gauge field} \(\mathcal{A}_\mu(x)
\equiv A_\mu^a(x) T^a\)\margincomment{Here it might be prudent to mention that
  \(\mathcal{A}_\mu\) is a real-valued field somehow.} which transforms according to
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{A}_\mu \to g \mathcal{A}_\mu g^{-1} - \frac{i}{q}
  \pclosed{\partial_\mu g} g^{-1}.
\end{equation}
The last term can compensate for the extra term in the ``transformation'' law
of \(\partial_\mu\).
We can then define the covariant derivative \(D_\mu = \partial_\mu - iq
\mathcal{A}_\mu\) to achieve this.
\medskip

In summary, with a local gauge symmetry, a gauge field \(\mathcal{A}_\mu\) must
be introduced such that kinetic terms in the original Lagrangian can be
invariant under the gauge transformation. In our case this amounts to adding
the interaction term
\begin{equation}
  \L_{\mathcal{A}\Phi\text{-int}} = -iq\bclosed{(\partial^\mu \Phi^\dagger)
    \mathcal{A}_\mu \Phi - \Phi^\dagger \mathcal{A}^\mu (\partial_\mu
    \Phi)} + q^2
  \Phi^\dagger \mathcal{A}^\mu \mathcal{A}_\mu \Phi
\end{equation}
to the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian \(\L_{KG}\).

Now, the Lagrangian is gauge invariant, but there still remains to add dynamics
to the gauge field \(\mathcal{A}_\mu\) through a kinetic term.
To this end, we can make a field-strength tensor \(\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu} \equiv
F_{\mu\nu}^a T^a\) that transforms as \(\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu} \to g
\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu} g^{-1}\).
The covariant derivative already has this property, and so we can define
\(\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{q} \commutator{D_\mu}{D_\nu}\), which will include
derivative terms for the \(\mathcal{A}_\mu\) gauge field and let us construct a
gauge invariant kinetic term \(\tr\cclosed{\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu} \mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}}\).
Antisymmetrising \(D_\mu D_\nu \to \commutator{D_\mu}{D_\nu}\) serves to get rid of the \(\partial_\mu \partial_\nu\)-term which would result in third derivatives of the gauge field.
The kinetic term can be shown to be gauge invariant using the transformation law the field-strength tensor and the cyclic property of the trace
\begin{equation}
  \tr\{\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu} \mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}\} \to
  \tr\{g \mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu} \mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu} g^{-1}\} =
  \tr\{g^{-1} g \mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu} \mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}\} =
  \tr\{\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu} \mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}\}.
\end{equation}
This results in a kinetic term for the \(\mathcal{A}_\mu\)-field
\begin{equation}
  \label{qft:eq:Akin}
  \L_{\mathcal{A}\text{-kin}} = -\frac{1}{4T(R)} \tr\{\mathcal{F}^{\mu\nu} \mathcal{F}_{\mu_\nu}\} = -\frac{1}{4} F^{a\,\mu\nu} F^a_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where \(T(R)\) is the Dynkin index of the representation \(R\) of the group defined by the relation \(\tr\{T^a T^b\} = T(R) \delta^{ab}\) when \(T^a\) are the generators of the group in that representation.

\subsection{Dimensional Regularisation}




\subsection{Passarino-Veltman Loop Integrals}
\label{qft:subsec:pave}
By Lorentz invariance, there are a limited set of forms that loop integrals
can
take.\needcite[Why is this?] These can be categorised according to the number
of propagator terms they include, which corresponds to the number of externally
connected points there are in the loop. A general scalar \(N\)-point loop
integral takes the form
\begin{align}
  T^N_0\pclosed{p_i^2, (p_i-p_j)^2; m_0^2, m_i^2} & = \frac{\pclosed{2\pi
      \mu}^{4-d}}{i \pi^2} \integral{^d q} \mathcal{D}_0
  \prod_{i=1}^{N-1}
  \mathcal{D}_i,
\end{align}
where \(\mathcal{D}_0 = \bclosed{q^2-m_0^2}^{-1}\) and \(\mathcal{D}_i =
\bclosed{\pclosed{q+p_i}^2-m_i^2}^{-1}\).
The first 4 scalar loop integrals are named accordingly
\begin{align}
  T^1_0 & \equiv A_0(m_0^2)
  \\
  T^2_0 & \equiv B_0(p_1^2; m_0^2, m_1^2)
  \\
  T^3_0 & \equiv C_0(p_1^2, p_2^2, (p_1-p_2)^2; m_0^2, m_1^2, m_2^2)
  \\
  T^4_0 & \equiv D_0(p_1^2, p_2^2, p_3^2, (p_1-p_2)^2, (p_1-p_3)^2,
  (p_2-p_3)^2; m_0^2, m_1^2, m_2^2)
\end{align}

\end{figure}

More complicated Lorentz structure can be obtained in loop integrals, however,
these can still be related to the scalar integrals by exploiting the possible
tensorial structure they can have. Defining an arbitrary loop integral
\begin{equation}
  T^N_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_P}\pclosed{p_i^2, (p_i-p_j)^2; m_0^2, m_i^2} =
  \frac{\pclosed{2\pi \mu}^{4-d}}{i \pi^2} \integral{^d q} q_{\mu_1}\cdots
  q_{\mu_P} \mathcal{D}_0 \prod_{i=1}^{N-1} \mathcal{D}_i.
\end{equation}
These tensors can only depend on the metric \(\tensor{g}{^\mu^\nu}\) and the
external momenta \(p_i\).
The possible structures up to four-point loops are as following:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    B^\mu                & = p_1^\mu B_1,
    \\
    B^{\mu\nu}           & = g^{\mu\nu} B_{00} + p_1^\mu p_1^\nu B_{11},
    \\
    C^\mu                & = \sum_{i=1}^2 p_i^\mu C_i,
    \\
    C^{\mu\nu}           & = g^{\mu\nu} C_{00} + \sum_{i,j=1}^{2} p_i^\mu
