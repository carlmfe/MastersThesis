    \subsection{A Simple Supersymmetric Theory}
        To illustrate what supersymmetry looks like in practice, it can be helpful to look at a simple example.
        Take a Lagrangian for a massive complex scalar field \(\phi\) and a massive Weyl spinor field \(\psi\)
        \begin{equation}
            \L = (\partial\_{\mu} \phi)(\partial\^{\mu}\phi^\ast) + i \psi \sigma\^{\mu} \partial\_{\mu} \bar{\psi}
            - \abs{m_B}^2 \phi \phi^\ast - \frac{1}{2}m_F (\psi\psi) - \frac{1}{2} m_F^\ast (\bar{\psi}\bar{\psi}).
        \end{equation}
        To impose some symmetry between the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, we want to examine a transformation of the scalar field through the spinor field and vice versa.
        A general, infinitesimal such transformation can be parametrised by
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{align}
                \delta\phi                     & = \epsilon a (\theta\psi),                                                                                                                       \\
                \delta\phi^\ast                & = \epsilon a^\ast (\bar{\theta}\bar{\psi}),                                                                                                      \\
                \delta\psi\_{\alpha}           & = \epsilon \pclosed{c (\sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\theta})\_{\alpha} \partial\_{\mu} \phi + F(\phi, \phi^\ast) \theta\_{\alpha}},                        \\
                \delta\bar{\psi}\_{\dot\alpha} & = \epsilon \pclosed{c^\ast (\theta \sigma\^{\mu})\_{\dot\alpha} \partial\_{\mu} \phi^\ast + F^\ast(\phi, \phi^\ast) \bar{\theta}\_{\dot\alpha}},
            \end{align}
        \end{subequations}
        where \(\epsilon\) is some infinitesimal parameter for the transformation, \(\theta\) is some Grassmann-valued Weyl spinor, \(a, c\) are complex coefficients of the transformation and \(F(\phi, \phi^\ast)\) is some linear function \(\phi\) and \(\phi^\ast\).
        The change in the scalar field part of the Lagrangian is
        \begin{equation}
            \label{susy:eq:dLphi}
            \delta\L_\phi / \epsilon = a (\theta\partial\_{\mu}\psi) \pclosed{\partial\^{\mu} \phi^\ast} - a\abs{m_B}^2 (\theta\psi) \phi^\ast + \cc,
        \end{equation}
        and likewise for the spinor field part
        \begin{equation}
            \label{susy:eq:dLpsi}
            \delta\L_\psi/\epsilon = -i c^\ast (\psi \sigma\^{\mu}\bar{\sigma}\^{\nu}\theta) \partial\_{\mu}\partial\_{\nu} \phi^\ast + i (\psi \sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\theta}) \partial\_{\mu} F^\ast + m_F \bclosed{c (\psi\sigma\^{\mu}\bar{\theta}) \partial\_{\mu} \phi + \psi\theta F} + \cc
        \end{equation}
        The first term in \cref{susy:eq:dLpsi} can be rewritten using the commutativity of partial derivatives and the identity \(\tensor{\pclosed{\sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\sigma}\^{\nu} + \sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\sigma}\^{\nu}}}{_\alpha^\beta} = -2\tensor{g}{^\mu^\nu} \tensor*{\delta}{_\alpha^\beta}\) to get \(i c^\ast \pclosed{\theta \psi} \partial\_{\mu}\partial\^{\mu} \phi^\ast\).
        Up to a total derivative, we can then write the change in the spinor part as
        \begin{equation}
            \delta\L_\psi/\epsilon = -i c^\ast (\theta\partial\_{\mu}\psi)\partial\^{\mu} \phi^\ast + (\psi \sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\theta}) \partial\_{\mu} \pclosed{i F^\ast + m_F c \phi} + m_F \theta\psi F + \cc.
        \end{equation}
        The total change of the Lagrangian (again up to a total derivate) can then be grouped as
        \begin{align}
            \nonumber
            \delta\L/\epsilon = & \pclosed{a-ic^\ast} (\theta\partial\_{\mu}\psi) \pclosed{\partial\^{\mu} \phi^\ast}
            + (\psi \sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\theta}) \partial\_{\mu} \pclosed{i F^\ast + m_F c \phi}                       \\
                                & + (\theta\psi) \pclosed{a\abs{m_B}^2\phi^\ast + m_F F} + \cc,
        \end{align}
        giving us three different conditions for the action to be invariant:
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{align}
                a - ic^\ast                    & = 0, \\
                i F^\ast + m_F c \phi          & = 0, \\
                a\abs{m_B}^2 \phi^\ast + m_F F & = 0.
            \end{align}
        \end{subequations}
        This is fulfilled if
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{align}
                c            & = i a^\ast,              \\
                F            & = -a m_F^\ast \phi^\ast, \\
                a\abs{m_B}^2 & = a^\ast \abs{m_F}^2.
            \end{align}
        \end{subequations}
        What is interesting is the last condition, because it requires \(a\) to be real, as both \(\abs{m_B}^2\) and \(\abs{m_F}^2\) are real, but also requires \(\abs{m_B}^2 = \abs{m_F}^2\).
        For the theory to be supersymmetric in this sense, the masses of the boson and fermion must be the same!

        Revisiting \(F\), it can be introduced as an auxiliary field to bookkeep the supersymmetry transformation.
        By including the non-dynamical term to the Lagrangian \(\L_F = F^\ast F + m F \phi + m^\ast F^\ast \phi^\ast\), we make sure \(F\) takes the correct value in the transformation from its equation of motion
        \(\pd[F]{\L} = F^\ast + m \phi \mbeq 0\).
        Inserting \(F\) back into the Lagrangian reproduces the mass term of the scalar field, allowing us to write the original Lagrangian as
        \begin{align}
            \L = & (\partial\_{\mu} \phi)(\partial\^{\mu}\phi^\ast) + i \psi \sigma\^{\mu} \partial\_{\mu} \bar{\psi} + F^\ast F + m F \phi + m^\ast F^\ast \phi^\ast - \frac{1}{2}m (\psi\psi) - \frac{1}{2}m^\ast (\bar{\psi}\bar{\psi}),
        \end{align}
        with the \emph{supersymmetry transformation} rules
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{align}
                 & \delta\phi       = \epsilon (\theta \psi),                                                                                                               &
                 & \delta\phi^\ast = \epsilon (\bar{\theta}\bar{\psi}),                                                                                                       \\
                 & \delta\psi\_{\alpha} = \epsilon \pclosed{-i(\sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\theta})\_{\alpha} \partial\_{\mu} \phi  + F \theta\_{\alpha}},                           &
                 & \delta\bar{\psi}\_{\dot\alpha} = \epsilon \pclosed{i(\theta \sigma\^{\mu})\_{\dot\alpha} \partial\_{\mu} \phi^\ast + F^\ast \bar{\theta}\_{\dot\alpha}},   \\
                 & \delta F         = i \epsilon \pclosed{\partial\_{\mu} \psi \sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\theta}},                                                                 &
                 & \delta F^\ast = -i \epsilon \pclosed{\theta \sigma\^{\mu} \partial\_{\mu} \bar{\psi}},
            \end{align}
        \end{subequations}
        where I have set \(a=1\) without loss of generality, and found the appropriate transformation law for \(F\) such that the Lagrangian is invariant up to total derivatives.
        The dynamics of this Lagrangian are the same as before, but the supersymmetry is now made manifest, i.e.~the transformation needs no figuring out of coefficients to work generally.

        In fact, one can show that a general supersymmetric Lagrangian consisting of a scalar field and a fermion field can be written
        \begin{equation}
            \L = (\partial\_{\mu} \phi)(\partial\^{\mu}\phi^\ast) + i \psi \sigma\^{\mu} \partial\_{\mu} \bar{\psi} + F^\ast F + \cclosed{m F \phi - \frac{1}{2}m (\psi\psi) - \lambda \phi (\psi\psi) + \cc}
        \end{equation}
        up to renormalisable interactions.

\section{The Super-Poincaré Group}
    \phpar[Introduce the Super-Poincaré algebra, and superspace as a vessel for manifestly supersymmetric theories.
        Lead into superfields, and general supersymmetric superlagrangians.]

    \subsection{The Poincaré and Super-Poincaré Algebras}


    \subsection{Superspace}
        To facilitate the construction of supersymmetric theories, it will be helpful to construct a space such that the generators of the Super-Poincaré group manifest as simple coordinate transformations, as in the case of the ordinary Poincaré group.
        Starting with a general element \(g \in SP\), it can be parametrised through the exponential map as
        \begin{equation}
            g = \exptext{ix\^{\mu} P\_{\mu} + i(\theta Q) + i (\bar{\theta}\bar{Q}) + \frac{i}{2}\tensor{\omega}{_\mu_\nu}\tensor{M}{^\mu^\nu}},
        \end{equation}
        where \(x^\mu, \theta\^{\alpha}, \bar{\theta}\_{\dot\alpha}, \tensor{\omega}{_\mu_\nu}\) parametrise the group, and \(P_\mu, Q\_{\alpha}, \bar{Q}\^{\dot\alpha}, \tensor{M}{^\mu^\nu}\) are the generators of the group.
        Since the parameters \(x\^{\mu}, \theta\^{\alpha}, \bar{\theta}\_{\dot\alpha}\) live in a representation of the Lorentz algebra generated by \(\tensor{M}{^\mu^\nu}\), the effect of this part of the Super-Poincaré group on the parameters can be determined easily.
        Likewise, the parameters \(\tensor{\omega}{_\mu_\nu}\) are in a trivial representation of the algebra generated by \(P\_{\mu}, Q\_{\alpha}, \bar{Q}\^{\dot\alpha}\), and need not then be considered.
        It is therefore poignant to create a space with \(x\^{\mu}, \theta\^{\alpha}, \bar{\theta}\_{\dot\alpha}\) as the coordinates, modding out the Lorentz algebra part.
        We create superspace as a coordinate system with coordinates \(z\^{\pi} = (x\^{\mu}, \theta\^{\alpha}, \bar{\theta}\^{\dot\alpha})\), and look at how they transform under Super-Poincaré group transformations.
        A function \(F(z)\) on superspace can then be written using the generators \(K\_\pi = (P\_\mu, Q\_\alpha, \bar{Q}\_{\dot\alpha})\) as \(F(z) = \exptext{iz\^\pi K\_\pi} f(0)\).
        Applying a Super-Poincaré group element without the Lorentz generators \(\bar{g}(a, \eta) = \exptext{ia\^\mu P\_\mu + i (\eta Q) + i (\bar{\eta}\bar{Q})}\) we have
        \begin{equation}
            F(z^\prime) = \exptext{i{z^\prime}\^\pi K\_\pi} f(0) = \exptext{ia\^\mu P\_\mu + i (\eta Q) + i (\bar{\eta}\bar{Q})} \exptext{iz\^\pi K\_\pi} f(0),
        \end{equation}
        which by the \needcite[Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff] formula gives
        \begin{equation}
            {z^\prime}\^\pi K\_\pi = (x\^\mu + a\^\mu) P\_\mu + (\theta\^\alpha + \eta\^\alpha)Q\_\alpha + (\bar{\theta}\_{\dot\alpha} + \bar{\eta}\_{\dot\alpha})\bar{Q}\^{\dot\alpha} + \frac{i}{2}\bclosed{a\^\mu P\_\mu + (\eta Q) + (\bar{\eta}\bar{Q}), z\^\pi K\_\pi} + \ldots
        \end{equation}
        Now, \(P\_\mu\) commutes with all of \(K\_\pi\), and \(Q\_\alpha\) (\(\bar{Q}\^{\dot\alpha}\)) anti-commute with themselves, for every combination of different \(\alpha\) (\(\dot\alpha\)), so the only relevant part of the commutator is
        \begin{equation}
            \commutator{(\eta Q)}{(\bar\theta \bar{Q})} + \commutator{(\bar\eta \bar{Q})}{(\theta Q)} = -\eta\^\alpha \anticommutator{Q\_\alpha}{\bar{Q}\_{\dot\alpha}} \bar\theta\^{\dot\alpha} + (\eta \leftrightarrow \theta) = -2(\eta \sigma\^\mu \bar\theta)P\_\mu + (\eta \leftrightarrow \theta).
        \end{equation}
        Since this commutator is proportional to \(P\_\mu\) which in turn commutes with everything, all higher order commutator vanish, and we can conclude that the transformed coordinates \({z^\prime}\^\pi\) are given by
        \begin{equation}
            {z^\prime}\^\pi = \pclosed{x\^\mu + a\^\mu + i(\theta \sigma\^\mu \bar\eta) - i(\eta \sigma\^\mu \bar\theta), \theta\^\alpha + \eta\^\alpha, \bar\theta\_{\dot\alpha} + \bar\eta\_{\dot\alpha}}.
        \end{equation}
        This gives us a differential representation of the \(K\_\pi\) generators as
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{align}
                P\_\mu                & = -i \partial\_\mu,                                                                   \\
                Q\_\alpha             & = - (\sigma\^\mu \bar\theta)\_\alpha \partial\_\mu - i \partial\_\alpha,              \\
                \bar{Q}\_{\dot\alpha} & = -(\theta \bar{\sigma}\^\mu)\_{\dot\alpha} \partial\_\mu - i \partial\_{\dot\alpha}.
            \end{align}
        \end{subequations}

        Now, to look into what the these functions of superspace look like, we can expand \(F(z)\) in terms of the coordinates \(\theta\^\alpha, \bar\theta\_{\dot\alpha}\), as these expansions are finite due to the factor that none of these coordinates can appear more than once.
        Demanding that the function \(F(z)\) be invariant under Lorentz transformations, the \(x\^\mu\)-dependendt coefficients of the expansion must transform such that each term is a scalar (or fully contracted Lorentz structure).
        This limits a general such function of superspace to be written as
        \begin{align}
            \label{susy:eq:superspace_function}
            \nonumber
            F(z) = & f(x) + \theta\^\alpha \phi\_\alpha(x) + \bar\theta\_{\dot\alpha} \bar\chi\^{\dot\alpha}(x) + (\theta\theta) m(x) + (\bar\theta\bar\theta) n(x)                                                                          \\
                   & + (\theta \sigma\^\mu \bar\theta) V\_\mu(x) + (\theta\theta) \bar\theta\_{\dot\alpha} \bar\lambda\^{\dot\alpha}(x) + (\bar\theta\bar\theta) \theta\^\alpha \psi\_\alpha(x) + (\theta\theta)(\bar\theta\bar\theta) d(x).
        \end{align}


    \subsection{Superfields}
        To construct a manifestly supersymmetric theory, it will then be useful to start with finding representations of the Super-Poincaré group.
        This is exactly what we have already done; the functions on superspace find themselves in a representation space of a differential representation of the \(K\_\pi\) generators of the Super-Poincaré group, and a scalar representation of the remaining Lorentz generators.
        Inside the general function on superspace \cref{susy:eq:superspace_function}, we find many component functions in different representation spaces of the Lorentz group.
        Furthermore, supersymmetry transformations transform these fields into one another.
        This seems like an ideal vessel for constructing supersymmetric fields theories.

        We define the \emph{superfield} \(\Phi\) as an operator valued function on superspace.
        The general one \cref{susy:eq:superspace_function} is in a reducible representation space of the Super-Poincaré group, so we define three \emph{irreducible} representations that will be useful going forward:
        \begin{align}
            \textit{Left-handed scalar superfield:}  &  & \bar{D}\_{\dot\alpha}\Phi & = 0    \\
            \textit{Right-handed scalar superfield:} &  & D\_{\alpha}\Phi^\dagger   & = 0    \\
            \textit{Vector superfield:}              &  & \Phi^\dagger              & = \Phi
        \end{align}
        Here the dagger operation refers to complex conjugation, and the differential operators \(D\_\alpha, \bar{D}\_{\dot\alpha}\) are defined as
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{align}
                D\_\alpha             & = \partial\_\alpha + i(\sigma\^\mu \bar\theta)\_\alpha \partial\_\mu,          \\
                \bar{D}\_{\dot\alpha} & = -\partial\_{\dot\alpha} - i (\theta\sigma\^\mu)\_{\dot\alpha} \partial\_\mu.
            \end{align}
        \end{subequations}
        These differential operators are covariant differentials in the sense that the commute with supersymmetry transformations
