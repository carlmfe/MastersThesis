\section{Introduction to Supersymmetry}
\phpar[Introduce supersymmetry, what the symmetry is and how it transforms fermionic and bosonic fields through each other.
    Introduce superspace, Grassmann calculus, superfields and superlagrangians.]

\subsection{A Simple Supersymmetric Theory}
To illustrate what supersymmetry looks like in practice, it can be helpful to
look at a simple example. Take a Lagrangian for a massive complex scalar field
\(\phi\) and a massive Weyl spinor field \(\psi\)
\begin{equation}
    \L = (\partial\_{\mu} \phi)(\partial\^{\mu}\phi^\ast) + i \psi \sigma\^{\mu} \partial\_{\mu} \psi^\dagger
    - \abs{m_B}^2 \phi \phi^\ast - \frac{1}{2}m_F (\psi\psi) - \frac{1}{2} m_F^\ast (\psi\psi)^\dagger.
\end{equation}
To impose some symmetry between the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, we want to examine a transformation of the scalar field through the spinor field and vice versa.
A general, infinitesimal such transformation can be parametrised by
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \delta\phi                         & = \epsilon a (\theta\psi),                                                                                                                                   \\
        \delta\phi^\ast                    & = \epsilon a^\ast (\theta\psi)^\dagger,                                                                                                                      \\
        \delta\psi\_{\alpha}               & = \epsilon \pclosed{c (\sigma\^{\mu} \theta^\dagger)\_{\alpha} \partial\_{\mu} \phi + F(\phi, \phi^\ast) \theta\_{\alpha}},                                  \\
        \delta{\psi^\dagger}\_{\dot\alpha} & = \epsilon \pclosed{c^\ast (\theta \sigma\^{\mu})\_{\dot\alpha} \partial\_{\mu} \phi^\ast + F^\ast(\phi, \phi^\ast) \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}}},
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where \(\epsilon\) is some infinitesimal parameter for the transformation, \(\theta\) is some Grassmann-valued Weyl spinor, \(a, c\) are complex coefficients of the transformation and \(F(\phi, \phi^\ast)\) is some linear function \(\phi\) and \(\phi^\ast\).
The change in the scalar field part of the Lagrangian is
\begin{equation}
    \label{susy:eq:dLphi}
    \delta\L_\phi / \epsilon = a (\theta\partial\_{\mu}\psi) \pclosed{\partial\^{\mu} \phi^\ast} - a\abs{m_B}^2 (\theta\psi) \phi^\ast + \cc,
\end{equation}
and likewise for the spinor field part
\begin{equation}
    \label{susy:eq:dLpsi}
    \delta\L_\psi/\epsilon = -i c^\ast (\psi \sigma\^{\mu}\bar{\sigma}\^{\nu}\theta) \partial\_{\mu}\partial\_{\nu} \phi^\ast + i (\psi \sigma\^{\mu} \theta^\dagger) \partial\_{\mu} F^\ast + m_F \bclosed{c (\psi\sigma\^{\mu}\theta^\dagger) \partial\_{\mu} \phi + (\psi\theta) F} + \cc
\end{equation}
The first term in \cref{susy:eq:dLpsi} can be rewritten using the commutativity of partial derivatives and the identity \(\tensor{\pclosed{\sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\sigma}\^{\nu} + \sigma\^{\mu} \bar{\sigma}\^{\nu}}}{_\alpha^\beta} = -2\tensor{g}{^\mu^\nu} \tensor*{\delta}{_\alpha^\beta}\) to get \(i c^\ast \pclosed{\theta \psi} \partial\_{\mu}\partial\^{\mu} \phi^\ast\).
Up to a total derivative, we can then write the change in the spinor part as
\begin{equation}
    \delta\L_\psi/\epsilon = -i c^\ast (\theta\partial\_{\mu}\psi)\partial\^{\mu} \phi^\ast + (\psi \sigma\^{\mu} \theta^\dagger) \partial\_{\mu} \pclosed{i F^\ast + m_F c \phi} + m_F \theta\psi F + \cc.
\end{equation}
The total change of the Lagrangian (again up to a total derivate) can then be grouped as
\begin{align}
    \nonumber
    \delta\L/\epsilon = & \pclosed{a-ic^\ast} (\theta\partial\_{\mu}\psi) \pclosed{\partial\^{\mu} \phi^\ast}
    + (\psi \sigma\^{\mu} \theta^\dagger) \partial\_{\mu} \pclosed{i F^\ast + m_F c \phi}                     \\
                        & + (\theta\psi) \pclosed{a\abs{m_B}^2\phi^\ast + m_F F} + \cc,
\end{align}
giving us three different conditions for the action to be invariant:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        a - ic^\ast                    & = 0, \\
        i F^\ast + m_F c \phi          & = 0, \\
        a\abs{m_B}^2 \phi^\ast + m_F F & = 0.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
This is fulfilled if
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        c            & = i a^\ast,              \\
        F            & = -a m_F^\ast \phi^\ast, \\
        a\abs{m_B}^2 & = a^\ast \abs{m_F}^2.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
What is interesting is the last condition, because it requires \(a\) to be real, as both \(\abs{m_B}^2\) and \(\abs{m_F}^2\) are real, but also requires \(\abs{m_B}^2 = \abs{m_F}^2\).
For the theory to be supersymmetric in this sense, the masses of the boson and fermion must be the same!

Revisiting \(F\), it can be introduced as an auxiliary field to bookkeep the
supersymmetry transformation. By including the non-dynamical term to the
Lagrangian \(\L_F = F^\ast F + m F \phi + m^\ast F^\ast \phi^\ast\), we make
sure \(F\) takes the correct value in the transformation from its equation of
motion \(\pd[F]{\L} = F^\ast + m \phi \mbeq 0\). Inserting \(F\) back into the
Lagrangian reproduces the mass term of the scalar field, allowing us to write
the original Lagrangian as
\begin{align}
    \L = & (\partial\_{\mu} \phi)(\partial\^{\mu}\phi^\ast) + i \psi \sigma\^{\mu} \partial\_{\mu} \psi^\dagger + F^\ast F + m F \phi + m^\ast F^\ast \phi^\ast - \frac{1}{2}m (\psi\psi) - \frac{1}{2}m^\ast (\psi\psi)^\dagger,
\end{align}
with the \emph{supersymmetry transformation} rules
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
         & \delta\phi       = \epsilon (\theta \psi),                                                                                                                                       &
         & \delta\phi^\ast = \epsilon (\theta\psi)^\dagger,                                                                                                                                   \\
         & \delta\psi\_{\alpha} = \epsilon \pclosed{-i(\sigma\^{\mu} \theta^\dagger)\_{\alpha} \partial\_{\mu} \phi  + F \theta\_{\alpha}},                                                 &
         & \delta\psi\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} = \epsilon \pclosed{i(\theta \sigma\^{\mu})\_{\dot\alpha} \partial\_{\mu} \phi^\ast + F^\ast \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}}},   \\
         & \delta F         = i \epsilon \pclosed{\partial\_{\mu} \psi \sigma\^{\mu} \theta^\dagger},                                                                                       &
         & \delta F^\ast = -i \epsilon \pclosed{\theta \sigma\^{\mu} \partial\_{\mu} \psi^\dagger},
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where I have set \(a=1\) without loss of generality, and found the appropriate transformation law for \(F\) such that the Lagrangian is invariant up to total derivatives.
The dynamics of this Lagrangian are the same as before, but the supersymmetry is now made manifest, i.e.~the transformation is free of any dependence on the contents of the Lagrangian.

In fact, one can show that a general supersymmetric Lagrangian consisting of a
scalar field and a fermion field can be written
\begin{equation}
    \L = (\partial\_{\mu} \phi)(\partial\^{\mu}\phi^\ast) + i \psi \sigma\^{\mu} \partial\_{\mu} \psi^\dagger + F^\ast F + \cclosed{m F \phi - \frac{1}{2}m (\psi\psi) - \lambda \phi (\psi\psi) + \cc}
\end{equation}
up to renormalisable interactions.

\section{The Super-Poincaré Group}
\phpar[Introduce the Super-Poincaré algebra, and superspace as a vessel for manifestly supersymmetric theories.
    Lead into superfields, and general supersymmetric superlagrangians.]

\subsection{The Poincaré and Super-Poincaré Algebras}

\subsection{Superspace}
To facilitate the construction of supersymmetric theories, it will be helpful
to construct a space such that the generators of the Super-Poincaré group
manifest as simple coordinate transformations, as in the case of the ordinary
Poincaré group. Starting with a general element \(g \in SP\), it can be
parametrised through the exponential map as
\begin{equation}
    g = \exptext{ix\^{\mu} P\_{\mu} + i(\theta Q) + i (\theta Q)^\dagger + \frac{i}{2}\tensor{\omega}{_\mu_\nu}\tensor{M}{^\mu^\nu}},
\end{equation}
where \(x^\mu, \theta\^{\alpha}, \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}}, \tensor{\omega}{_\mu_\nu}\) parametrise the group, and \(P_\mu, Q\_{\alpha}, Q\indices*{^\dagger^{\dot\alpha}}, \tensor{M}{^\mu^\nu}\) are the generators of the group.
Since the parameters \(x\^{\mu}, \theta\^{\alpha}, \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}}\) live in a representation of the Lorentz algebra generated by \(\tensor{M}{^\mu^\nu}\), the effect of this part of the Super-Poincaré group on the parameters can be determined easily.
Likewise, the parameters \(\tensor{\omega}{_\mu_\nu}\) are in a trivial representation of the algebra generated by \(P\_{\mu}, Q\_{\alpha}, Q\indices*{^\dagger^{\dot\alpha}}\), and need not then be considered.
It is therefore poignant to create a space with \(x\^{\mu}, \theta\^{\alpha}, \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}}\) as the coordinates, modding out the Lorentz algebra part.
We create superspace as a coordinate system with coordinates \(z\^{\pi} = (x\^{\mu}, \theta\^{\alpha}, \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}})\), and look at how they transform under Super-Poincaré group transformations.
A function \(F(z)\) on superspace can then be written using the generators \(K\_\pi = (P\_\mu, Q\_\alpha, Q\indices*{^\dagger^{\dot\alpha}})\) as \(F(z) = \exptext{iz\^\pi K\_\pi} F(0)\).
Applying a Super-Poincaré group element without the Lorentz generators \(\bar{g}(a, \eta) = \exptext{ia\^\mu P\_\mu + i (\eta Q) + i (\eta Q)^\dagger}\) we have
\begin{equation}
    F(z^\prime) = \exptext{i{z^\prime}\^\pi K\_\pi} F(0) = \exptext{ia\^\mu P\_\mu + i (\eta Q) + i (\eta Q)^\dagger} \exptext{iz\^\pi K\_\pi} F(0),
\end{equation}
which by the \needcite[Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff] formula gives
\begin{equation}
    {z^\prime}\^\pi K\_\pi = (x\^\mu + a\^\mu) P\_\mu + (\theta\^\alpha + \eta\^\alpha)Q\_\alpha + (\theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} + \eta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}})Q\indices*{^\dagger^{\dot\alpha}} + \frac{i}{2}\bclosed{a\^\mu P\_\mu + (\eta Q) + (\eta Q)^\dagger, z\^\pi K\_\pi} + \ldots
\end{equation}
Now, \(P\_\mu\) commutes with all of \(K\_\pi\), and \(Q\_\alpha\) (\(Q\indices*{^\dagger^{\dot\alpha}}\)) anti-commute with themselves, for every combination of different \(\alpha\) (\(\dot\alpha\)), so the only relevant part of the commutator is
\begin{equation}
    \commutator{(\eta Q)}{(\theta Q)^\dagger} + \commutator{(\eta Q)^\dagger}{(\theta Q)} = -\eta\^\alpha \anticommutator{Q\_\alpha}{Q\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}}} \theta\indices*{^\dagger^{\dot\alpha}} + (\eta \leftrightarrow \theta) = -2(\eta \sigma\^\mu \theta^\dagger)P\_\mu + (\eta \leftrightarrow \theta).
\end{equation}
Since this commutator is proportional to \(P\_\mu\) which in turn commutes with everything, all higher order commutators vanish, and we can conclude that the transformed coordinates \({z^\prime}\^\pi\) are given by
\begin{equation}
    {z^\prime}\^\pi = \pclosed{x\^\mu + a\^\mu + i(\theta \sigma\^\mu \eta^\dagger) - i(\eta \sigma\^\mu \theta^\dagger), \theta\^\alpha + \eta\^\alpha, \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} + \eta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}}}.
\end{equation}
This gives us a differential representation of the \(K\_\pi\) generators as
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        P\_\mu                            & = -i \partial\_\mu,                                                                   \\
        Q\_\alpha                         & = - (\sigma\^\mu \theta^\dagger)\_\alpha \partial\_\mu - i \partial\_\alpha,          \\
        Q\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} & = -(\theta \bar{\sigma}\^\mu)\_{\dot\alpha} \partial\_\mu - i \partial\_{\dot\alpha}.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Now, to look into what the these functions of superspace look like, we can
expand \(F(z)\) in terms of the coordinates \(\theta\^\alpha,
\theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}}\), as these expansions are finite due to
the fact that none of these coordinates can appear more than once. Demanding
that the function \(F(z)\) be invariant under Lorentz transformations, the
\(x\^\mu\)-dependendt coefficients of the expansion must transform such that
each term is a scalar (or fully contracted Lorentz structure). This limits a
general such function of superspace to be written as
\begin{align}
    \label{susy:eq:superspace_function}
    \nonumber
    F(z) = & f(x) + \theta\^\alpha \phi\_\alpha(x) + \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} \chi\indices*{^\dagger^{\dot\alpha}}(x) + (\theta\theta) m(x) + (\theta\theta)^\dagger n(x)                                                                              \\
           & + (\theta \sigma\^\mu \theta^\dagger) V\_\mu(x) + (\theta\theta) \theta\indices*{^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} \lambda\indices*{^\dagger^{\dot\alpha}}(x) + (\theta\theta)^\dagger \theta\^\alpha \psi\_\alpha(x) + (\theta\theta)(\theta\theta)^\dagger d(x).
\end{align}

\subsection{Superfields}
To construct a manifestly supersymmetric theory, it will then be useful to
start with finding representations of the Super-Poincaré group. This is exactly
what we have already done; the functions on superspace find themselves in a
representation space of a differential representation of the \(K\_\pi\)
generators of the Super-Poincaré group, and a scalar representation of the
remaining Lorentz generators. Inside the general function on superspace
\cref{susy:eq:superspace_function}, we find many component functions in
different representation spaces of the Lorentz group. Furthermore,
supersymmetry transformations transform these fields into one another. This
seems like an ideal vessel for constructing supersymmetric fields theories.

We define the \emph{superfield} \(\Phi\) as an operator valued function on
superspace. The general one \cref{susy:eq:superspace_function} is in a
reducible representation space of the Super-Poincaré group, so we define three
\emph{irreducible} representations that will be useful going forward:
\begin{align}
    \textit{Left-handed scalar superfield:}  &  & \bar{D}\_{\dot\alpha}\Phi & = 0    \\
    \textit{Right-handed scalar superfield:} &  & D\_{\alpha}\Phi^\dagger   & = 0    \\
    \textit{Vector superfield:}              &  & \Phi^\dagger              & = \Phi
\end{align}
Here the dagger operation refers to complex conjugation, and the differential operators \(D\_\alpha, \bar{D}\_{\dot\alpha}\) are defined as
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        D\_\alpha             & = \partial\_\alpha + i(\sigma\^\mu \theta^\dagger)\_\alpha \partial\_\mu,      \\
        \bar{D}\_{\dot\alpha} & = -\partial\_{\dot\alpha} - i (\theta\sigma\^\mu)\_{\dot\alpha} \partial\_\mu.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
These differential operators are covariant differentials in the sense that the commute with supersymmetry transformations, i.e. \(D\_\alpha F(z) \to {D^\prime}\_\alpha (\bar{g} F(z)) = \bar{g} \pclosed{D\_\alpha F(z)}\)

    \item [\checked] Introduce Supergauge transformations and Super-Yang-Mills.
    \item Talk about Wess-Zumino gauge.
    \item Find the kinetic term for \(\mathcal{V}\).
\end{TODO}

\subsection{Superymmetric Yang-Mills Theory}
Before getting into the MSSM content, we must introduce what Yang-Mills theory
looks like at a superlagangian level. We define a \textit{supergauge
    transformation} of a left-handed scalar superfield multiplet \(\Phi\)
analogously to the ordinary case \cref{qft:eq:gauge_transformation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{susy:eq:supergauge_transformation}
    \Phi \to \exptext{i \Lambda} \Phi,
\end{equation}
where \(\Lambda \equiv \Lambda^a T^a\), \(\Lambda^a\) are the parameters of the transformation and \(T^a\) are again the generators of the gauge group.
To get a sense of what these parameters are, we can require the transformed superfield to be left-handed
\begin{align*}
    D_{\dot{\alpha}}^\dagger \exptext{i\Lambda} \Phi = & i\pclosed{D_{\dot{\alpha}}^\dagger \Lambda^a} T^a \exptext{i\Lambda^a T^a} \Phi + \exptext{i\Lambda^a T^a} D_{\dot{\alpha}}^\dagger \Phi \\
    =                                                  & i\pclosed{D_{\dot{\alpha}}^\dagger \Lambda^a} T^a \exptext{i\Lambda^a T^a} \Phi \mbeq 0,
\end{align*}
which means that we must require \(D_{\dot{\alpha}}^\dagger \Lambda^a = 0\), meaning that the parameters are themselves left-handed scalar superfields.
Examining how the kinetic term \(\Phi^\dagger \Phi\) does under this transformation we can see that\footnote{Using the \needcite[Baker-Campell-Hausdorff formula] to combine the exponentials.}
\begin{equation}
    \Phi^\dagger \Phi \to \Phi^\dagger \exp{-i\Lambda^\dagger} \exp{i\Lambda} \Phi = \Phi^\dagger \exp{i\pclosed{\Lambda - \Lambda^\dagger} - \frac{1}{2} \commutator{\Lambda}{\Lambda^\dagger} + \ldots} \Phi,
\end{equation}
which is not invariant. To remedy this, we will introduce a term to compensate for this change, like before.
Introducing a \textit{supergauge field} \(\mathcal{V} \equiv V^a T^a\) which transforms according to\footnote{The factor of 2 in the exponential here seems arbitrary at first, and is just a matter of choice. It is chosen to be 2 here such that the tansformation of law for \(\mathcal{V}\) is proportional to \(\Lambda\) without any numerical factors.}
\begin{equation}
    \exp{2q\mathcal{V}} \to \exp{i\Lambda^\dagger} \exp{2q\mathcal{V}} \exp{-i\Lambda},
\end{equation}
we can achieve an invariant kinetic term \(\Phi^\dagger \exp{2q\mathcal{V}} \Phi^\dagger\).
Since we require the superlagrangian term to be real, we must require \(\mathcal{V}^\dagger = \mathcal{V}\),
meaning it must be a vector superfield.
Infinitesimally this turns to\needcite{}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V} - \frac{i}{2q} \pclosed{\Lambda - \Lambda^\dagger} + \frac{i}{2} \commutator{\Lambda + \Lambda^\dagger}{\mathcal{V}}.

\subsection{Fermion Interactions from Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory}
\comment{This subsection might be best suited for an appendix?}

Considering an superlagrangian kinetic term \(\L = \Phi^\dagger_i
\pclosed{\exp{2q \mathcal{V}}}_{ij} \Phi_j\), I will extract the interaction
terms containing either the fermion fields multiplets \(\psi\) from \(\Phi\)
and the fermion fields \(\lambda \equiv \lambda^a T^a\) from \(\mathcal{V}
\equiv V^a T^a\). Up to terms with the appropriate amount of \(\theta\)s, we
have
\begin{align}
    \label{susy:eq:psi_kin_int}
    \nonumber
    \L & \stackrel{\psi, \psi^\dagger}{\supset} 2q \cclosed{ A^\ast_i (\theta\theta)^\dagger (\theta\lambda_{ij}) \sqrt{2} (\theta\psi_j) + \sqrt{2} (\theta\psi_i)^\dagger (\theta\sigma^\mu\theta^\dagger) \pclosed{\mathcal{V}_\mu}_{ij} \sqrt{2} (\theta\psi_j) + \sqrt{2} (\theta\psi_i)^\dagger (\theta\theta) (\theta\lambda_{ij})^\dagger A_j } \\
       & = q(\theta\theta)(\theta\theta)^\dagger \cclosed{ -\sqrt{2} A^\ast (\lambda\psi) + (\psi \sigma^\mu \mathcal{V}_\mu \psi^\dagger) - \sqrt{2} (\psi\lambda)^\dagger A },
\end{align}
where I have used \needcite[Weyl spinor relations]. \comment{Perhaps it should be clarified that these are all the \(\psi\)- \emph{and} \(\lambda\)-interactions.}

There are also Yukawa terms coming from the superpotential of the form \(\L =
y_{ij} (\theta\theta)^\dagger \Phi_i \Phi \Phi_j + \cc\) Extracting the
interaction terms of fermion field \(\psi\) from \(\Phi\), we find
\begin{align}
    \label{susy:eq:psi_yuk_int}
    \nonumber
    \L & \stackrel{\psi, \psi^\dagger}{\supset} y_{ij} (\theta\theta)^\dagger \sqrt{2} (\theta\psi) \cclosed{ A_i \sqrt{2}(\theta\psi_i) + \sqrt{2}(\theta\psi_j)A_j } + \cc \\
       & = -y_{ij} (\theta\theta)(\theta\theta)^\dagger \cclosed{ A_i(\psi\psi_j) + (\psi_i\psi)A_j + \cc }
\end{align}

\subsection{Wino and Bino Interactions}
First, I will look at the bino and wino interactions. Writing out the \(W^a\)
vector superfields in the basis \(W^\pm, W^0\), we are only interested in the
electrically neutral \(W^0\) bit. The interactions will come from kinetic terms
of scalar superfields \(\Phi\), whose relevant part can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \L = \Phi^\dagger \exp{2g\cclosed{Y t_W B^0 \pclosed{+ \frac{1}{2}\sigma_3 W^0}}} \Phi,
\end{equation}
where \(t_W \equiv \tan\theta_W\) is the tangent of the Weinberg angle and \(Y\) is the hypercharge of \(\Phi\).
To generalise this, I will use the isospin \(I^3\), which is \(+\frac{1}{2}\) for fields in the upper part of an SU(2) doublet, \(-\frac{1}{2}\) for fields in the lower part and 0 for SU(2) singlet fields.
Then the kinetic term can compactly be written as
\begin{equation}
    \L = \Phi^\dagger \exp{2g\cclosed{(Q_e - I^3) t_W B^0 + I^3 W^0}} \Phi,
\end{equation}
where \(Q_e\) is the electric charge of \(\Phi\).
\medskip

Extracting the interactions of the fermion fields \(\bino, \wino\) in \(B^0,
W^0\) using \cref{susy:eq:psi_kin_int}, we are left with (up to approprate
\(\theta\)s)
\begin{equation}
    \L \stackrel{\bino, \wino}{\supset} -\sqrt{2}g (\theta\theta)(\theta\theta)^\dagger \Big\{ (Q_e - I^3)t_W (\bino \psi) A^\ast + I^3 (\wino \psi) A^\ast + \cc \Big\}.
\end{equation}

\begin{temporary}
    \(q, \tilde{q}_L \in Q\), \(\bar{q}, \tilde{q}_R^\ast \in \bar{Q}\)
\end{temporary}

Considering an SM quark derive from the superfields \(Q\) and \(\bar{Q}\), with
electric charge \(Q_e\) and isospins \(I^3\) and 0 respectively, we can write
out the interaction as
\begin{equation}
    \L = -\sqrt{2}g \Big\{ (Q_e - I^3)t_W (\bino q) \tilde{q}_L^\ast + I^3 (\wino q) \tilde{q}_L^\ast + Q_e t_W (\bino \bar{q}) \tilde{q}_R^\ast + \cc \Big\}.
\end{equation}
Changing to the \(\nino\)-basis, we have that \(\bino = \sum_i N_{i1}^\ast \nino[i]\), \(\wino = \sum_i N_{i2}^\ast \nino[i]\), which together with writing out the Weyl products on Dirac spinor form yields
\begin{equation}
    \label{susy:eq:nino_sf_f_int}
    \L_{\tilde{\chi}^0 \tilde{q}q} = -\sqrt{2} g \sum_{i} \barnino[i] \Big\{ \big[ \underbrace{\pclosed{Q - I^3}t_W N_{i1}^\ast  + I^3 N_{i2}^\ast}_{\equiv C_{\tilde{\chi}^0_i \tilde{q} q}^{L\ast}} \big] \wtilde{q}_L^\ast P_L \underbrace{- Q_f t_W N_{i1}}_{\equiv C_{\tilde{\chi}^0_i \tilde{q} q}^{R\ast}} \wtilde{q}_R^\ast P_R \Big\} q_D + \cc
\end{equation}

Generalising this further to include squark mixing between the left- and
right-handed squarks in a generation \(i\), we have
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{q}_A = R_{A1}^{\tilde{q}_i} \tilde{q}_L + R_{A2}^{\tilde{q}_i} \tilde{q}_R,
\end{equation}
where \(R^{\tilde{q}_i}\) is a \(2\times 2\) unitary matrix transforming the quarks of type \(q = u, d\) in generation \(i\) to their mass eigenstates.
As such, we can write \(\tilde{q}_L = \pclosed{R^{\tilde{q}_i}_{A1}}^\ast \tilde{q}_A\), \(\tilde{q}_R = \pclosed{R^{\tilde{q}_i}_{A2}}^\ast \tilde{q}_A\) to get
\begin{equation}
    \label{susy:eq:nino_sqA_f_int}
    \L_{\tilde{\chi}^0 \tilde{q} q} = -\sqrt{2} g \sum_{i} \barnino[i] \Big\{ \underbrace{\pclosed{R^{\tilde{q}_i}_{A1}}^\ast C_{\tilde{\chi}^0_i \tilde{q} q}^{L\ast}}_{\equiv C_{\tilde{\chi}^0_i \tilde{q}_A q}^{L\ast}} P_L + \underbrace{\pclosed{R^{\tilde{q}_i}_{A2}}^\ast C_{\tilde{\chi}^0_i \tilde{q} q}^{R\ast}}_{\equiv C_{\tilde{\chi}^0_i \tilde{q}_A q}^{R\ast}} P_R \Big\} \wtilde{q}_A^\ast q_D + \cc
\end{equation}
\todo{Maybe comment on the extension to flavour violation.}

\subsection{Higgsino Interactions}
The Higgsino interaction with the (s)quarks comes from the Yukawa terms of the
superpotential, but seeing that this interaction is proportional to the quark
mass, it will be ignored at the centre-of-mass energies we are interested in.

The relevant interaction that remains is that with the \(Z\)-boson. This
interaction again comes from the kinetic term, but this time of the neutral
Higgs superfields in the superfield multiplets \(H_u = \pclosed{H_u^+,
    H_u^0}^T\), \(H_d = \pclosed{H_d^0, H_d^-}^T\). The Lagrangian is of the form
\begin{equation}
    \L = \pclosed{H_{u/d}^0}^\dagger \exp{\mp g\pclosed{W^0 - t_W B^0}} H_{u/d}^0.
\end{equation}
Integrating over the Grassman variables and using equation \cref{susy:eq:psi_kin_int} we get
\begin{equation}
    \integral{^4\theta} \L \stackrel{\tilde{H}_{u/d}^0, W^0_\mu, B^0_\mu}{=} \mp \frac{g}{2} \pclosed{\tilde{H}_{u/d}^0 \sigma^\mu \pclosed{\tilde{H}_{u/d}^0}^\dagger}\pclosed{W^0_\mu - t_W B_\mu^0}.
\end{equation}
Switching to Dirac spinors, the mass eigenbasis for the neutralinos and the \(Z\) boson \(Z_\mu = c_W W^0_\mu - s_W B^0_\mu\), we end up with\margincomment{Mention Weyl/Dirac identities necessary for this.}
\begin{align}
    \nonumber
    \L_{Z \tilde{\chi}^0} = \frac{g}{2c_W} Z_\mu \sum_{ij}\pclosed{N_{i4}N_{j4}^\ast - N_{i3}N_{j3}^\ast} \barnino[i] \gamma^\mu P_L \nino[j] \\
    = \frac{g}{2} Z_\mu \sum_{ij}\barnino[i] \gamma^\mu \bigg[ \underbrace{\frac{1}{2c_W}\pclosed{N_{i4}N_{j4}^\ast - N_{i3}N_{j3}^\ast}}_{\equiv O^{\prime\prime L}_{ij}} P_L \underbrace{-\frac{1}{2c_W}\pclosed{N_{i4}^\ast N_{j4} - N_{i3}^\ast N_{j3}}}_{\equiv O^{\prime\prime R}_{ij}} P_R \bigg] \nino[j]
\end{align}
